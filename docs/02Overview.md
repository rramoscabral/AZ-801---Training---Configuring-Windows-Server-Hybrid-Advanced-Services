<!-- Who should attend this course -->
### **Who should attend this course?**

IT professionals who will be responsible for configure advanced Windows Server services using on-premises, hybrid, and cloud technologies.

What is the difference between AZ-800 and AZ-801?
- AZ-800 focuses on Windows System Administration like access management, network security, and threat protection. 
- AZ-801 evaluates Azure Development skills like identity and access management, encryption, and security assessments.



<!-- Audience Profile -->
### **Participant profiles**
This four-day course is intended for Windows Server Hybrid Administrators who have experience working with Windows Server and want to extend the capabilities of their on-premises environments by combining on-premises and hybrid technologies. Windows Server Hybrid Administrators who already implement and manage on-premises core technologies want to secure and protect their environments, migrate virtual and physical workloads to Azure Iaas, enable a highly available, fully redundant environment, and perform monitoring and troubleshooting.
